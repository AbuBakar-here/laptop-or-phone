## FAQ

#### Does it gives prediction in terms of probability?

Yes, it can but you need to modify app.py a little which is inside Deployment folder.

#### What if I give an image which is not a Laptop or Phone?

It will give wrong prediction. I have thought about it but I haven't got a solution for that. Let me know if any of you have any solution for that.
